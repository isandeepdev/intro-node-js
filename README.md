# [Introduction to Node.js](01-introduction/README.md)

**Node.js** is an **open-source**, **cross-platform** JavaScript runtime that enables **server-side JavaScript execution**. It is built on a **non-blocking**, **event-driven architecture**, allowing it to efficiently handle multiple tasks concurrently. Node.js uses a **single-threaded event loop** to process **asynchronous operations**, making it ideal for **scalable real-time applications**, **web servers**, and **APIs**.

While it offers the advantage of using JavaScript for both client and server-side development and has a vast ecosystem via **NPM**, it faces challenges. Its **single-threaded nature** can struggle with **CPU-intensive tasks**, and scalability across **multiple cores** requires additional effort.
